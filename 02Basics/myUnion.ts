// Union : 
// A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values that 
// may be any one of those types. We refer to each of these types as the unionâ€™s members.

let score: number | string = 38

score = 46

type User = {
    name: string,
    id: number,
}

type Admin = {

}

let ayush: User | Admin = {name: "Ayush", id: 24}

// REMEMBER : while comparing put type inside quotes

// Union Narrowing:
// Within our if check, TypeScript sees typeof id === "string" and understands that 
// as a special form of code called a type guard. TypeScript follows possible paths of 
// execution that our programs can take to analyze the most specific possible type of a 
// value at a given position. It looks at these special checks (called type guards) and 
// assignments, and the process of refining types to more specific types than declared is 
// called narrowing.

// Array
